# Objects in JavaScript
JavaScript includes "objects" which are various collections of stored key-pairs and data. Objects are a fundamental part of understanding and using JavaScript in applications.  

Objects are one of the most important data-types in JavaScript. They have the ability to include all of the primitive data-types included in JS in assorted combinations.

Object keys have properties that include some sort of number, string, array, or function. They almost act as folders which hold a certain set of data or information. For example, a person may be considered an object and their "files" will include their age, name, birthday, etc. It is simply a batch of characteristics that define the object. Any property includes in an object can be added to, removed from, or modified using various notations at any time.

# Arrays in JavaScript
Another special element found in JavaScript is the array. An array is a list of values that are in a particular order. Just like objects, arrays have the capability of holding the various data-types such as strings, numbers, or boolean values. The length of an array does not need to be fixed or defined indefinitely -- it can always change upon analysis of its characteristics.  

Arrays come in handy when needing to create a collection of ordered elements that can be quickly be accessed by calling out the numerical position on the list as needed.
