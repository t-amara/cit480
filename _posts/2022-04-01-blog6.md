## Network-Attached Storage
NAS servers are storage devices that are able to connect to a network and host a central storage location for a specific set of users. They are very useful for both large organizations and home uses because of their scalability. They are quick, efficient, and pretty simple to operate.  

I am currently setting one up at my house so that I can utilize additional storage space and share access with my family members. It allows complete freedom of customization and comes at different price points so it can be affordable.  The NAS I am currently looking at purchasing comes with 2GB of digital storage capacity two bays for additional hard drives.
