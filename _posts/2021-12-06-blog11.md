# Introduction to SIEM
## What is SIEM? 
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. It is the merge between security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). SIEM is an optimized solution for security and protection against threats within an IT infrastructure. It logs all patterns and normalizes healthy data trends while filtering out any inconsistent behavior in the system.  


SIEM is useful because it gathers important data from the network's resources and analyzes which information and practices should be expected. If it detects any actions that are out of the ordinary, it will indicate that there may be a potential security threat in the works.

Security Information and Event Management offers the tools needed to identify any incoming attacks on the system while allowing enough time to react and respond accordingly. It's threat detection is considered advanced and is appropriate for organizations of all sizes. Some of the most important features that SIEM includes are: 
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Threat Intelligence 
- Forensic Abilities 
- Control Integrations

## SIEM Benefits
The advantages of implementing SIEM is that it reduces the amount of time needed to detect any potential threats which will, in turn, minimize any negative results or damages from the threats. It can support large amounts of information and data at once in order to efficiently filter through its logs - this is important for company scalability and expansion. SIEM will recognize a broad range of security threats no matter how large or small.
