# What is UEFI?
Unified extensible firmware interface is a program that communicates with a machine's operating system. It is initially installed during the manufacturing stage of a computer when developing its motherboard which is similar to the process of installing a machine's BIOS. Similarly, it monitors all of the machine's hardwired elements and activates all components upon startup. It then transfers control to the operating system for use. 

UEFI is compatible with modern day BIOS systems to enhances a computer's firmware. It can contain different boot up requirements and drivers but they both achieve the same goal.

## UEFI Benefits
1. Quick and efficient boot up
2. Higher drive capacity than currently available
3. Supports more than one operating systems at once
4. Discrete drivers
5. Customizable programmable functions
6. Remote secure boot configuration
