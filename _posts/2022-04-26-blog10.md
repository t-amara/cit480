Robotic Process Automation, RPA for short, is a software that utilizes both machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate recurring tasks in an efficient way. 
Some tasks that previously required a human to sort through and complete mundane tasks can now be recorded and monitored with RPA. 
Some daily operations may include but are not limited to:
- Handling transactions
- Maintaining logs and records
- Redirecting communication
- Addressing incoming inquiries
- Making calculations
- Invoicing clients and vendors
- Emailing internal and external contacts


## How does RPA work?
Robotic process automation works by developing a bot that will run through the necessary steps to complete a specific task. 
These tasks will reside in a dedicated console that will run through any workflows designated by the developers. 
There is usually a clear plan put into place to ensure that the bot only achieves what is necessary. 

## Benefits of RPA
1. Decreased costs
2. Streamlined recurring processes
3. Accurate information processing
4. Decreases repetitive tasks for valuable employees
5. Scalable software
