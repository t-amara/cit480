# The Box Model in CSS 

What is the box model? In CSS, the box model is utilized to layout a document in a web browser. Each element is modeled in a box format containing four different areas.

## Content Area  
The content box is the area where all of the HTML information and content resides. This box area is surrounded by the content edge. This includes text, images, audio, video, etc. This area also contains height and width and usually includes background colors or images.   

## Padding Area 
The box model includes an area for padding. Each element is formatted using padding that defines the space around the content box/area by a certain measure of distance. All sides of an element including top, bottom, right, and left can be given dimensions for their respective padding preferences.  

## Border Area
This model area is reserved for element borders. Borders modify the padding area to include an element's border dimensions. This space lives between the padding and the margin.  

## Margin Area
HTML elements can be separated from one another with margins. Margins are empty space alongside the border. They also utilize their own respective height and width. This area is useful to clean up the space outside of the border area.
