## What is Transfer Learning? 
Transfer learning is a method to tackle a new problem with a pre-existing solution model within machine learning. It uses a small amount of data that was used in another matter to apply it to the current environment. It can be trained to predict, analyze, and address the task by using the model history and any recognized patterns. This is a time-effective method that adapts an older standard instead of starting all over with a brand new solution. 

# How does transfer learning work? 
This type of learning detects similar layouts in previous tasks to contibute to the new task that requires the same type of function. It then transfers all of the information to the new layers and is trained to produce the new prompted data. Transfer learning is beneficial because it offers better preformance based on learned activity versus developing an entirely new system. It also does not require as many resources as it would to start from scratch.
