# Introduction to JavaScript 
JavaScript is a scripting language that is the third layer of computer code that is interpreted by the web browser. This layer comes after the HTML and CSS code that build the skeleton of a web page. JavaScript allows a web page to evolve from a static website to a dynamic website. Dynamic websites include multimedia, consistent interface updates, user interaction, and more.

## Is JavaScript necessary? 
JavaScript language and coding is not necessary for a static web page, however, it is the most commonly used scripting language for dynamic pages. JavaScript will modify any document code with HTML and CSS to regularly update the user pages with new information based on user input or time changes. This is the main way that the online pages we visit communicate with us and our behavior on the site.  

## JavaScript Features 
JavaScript has multiple features that make so many things possible on a website. These components are what makes it so versatile and convenient.  

### Data Types
Data types are required for each element of information so that any operational functions can be applied to them. Some examples of data types include arrays, objects, or booleans. Once the browser understands what type of data it is dealing with, it can administer any functions to make it behave accordingly.  

### Variables
JavaScript utilizes variables define data types. Variables will contain values that can be used in operational strings to quickly characterize this data's info. They will represent that value and apply it to all functions using that variable.  

### Functions 
Functions are blocks of code that are used in JavaScript to tell the browser what to carry out and when. Functions work with certain parameters and arguments to give these data types and variables behavior and purpose.  

This is the basic introduction to JavaScript and the general idea of how it operates alongside HTML and CSS in browser. JavaScript is extremely efficient and valuable in creating a network of dynamic web pages within a site.
