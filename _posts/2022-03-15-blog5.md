If the past two years have taught us anything, is that the internet and online computing are extremely valuable. Without remote access and online cloud services, many of society's daily functions would be halted. These quickly changing requirements have drastically accelerated the transition into hybrid cloud computing in both personal and commercial settings.  

The Internation Data Corporation has noted that 90% of all organizations across the globe will require more than on-site infrastructure to sustain themselves this year. Private and public clouds are necessary to meet the rising demand of streamlined services. It is also more secure and efficient to disperse utility premises than it is to store everything in one physical data center. There are many organizations that already opt to host completely on a cloud-based system.

The pace at which the need for cloud computing is rising is currently much faster than the ability to carry out these needs, making it much more crucial to invest in the correct resources to carry it out.
